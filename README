Apply erosions and dilations along lines at angles defined by a vector
field (typically derived from the gradient of a distance
transform). The positions at which the lines start will be defined by
a mask. This is a slightly dodgy operations, since lines can
intersect. The lines will therefore won't be processed in place.
